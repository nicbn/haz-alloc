haz-alloc is a general-purpose allocator written in Rust, inspired by jemalloc.


You probably want is the `haz-alloc` crate. It provides everything
out-of-the-box, ready to use.

If you want to use on some platform that `haz-alloc` does not support, you
can use `haz-alloc-core`, that implements the allocator, and provide the
system functions it uses.

## Supported platforms

Supported platforms by `haz-alloc`. `haz-alloc-core` is independent of platform
and should work on pretty much anything.
